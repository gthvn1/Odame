# OCRay

Try to write a "game" in OCaml using Raylib...

# Installation
- we created a new switch locally for the project
    - `opam switch create ./ 5.1.1`
    - `eval $(opam env)`
- and we install `dune` to manage the project
    - you can install others tools like `utop` or `ocaml-lsp-server`.
- we can run the project using `dune exec ogamel`
